----------------------------------------
Processing:

- clean columns:
    - drop unnecessary columns

- parse data:
    - parse dates and integers (versions not yet - there's some garbage)
    - map actions (1, 1F, ...) to human-readable strings

- remove garbage data:
    - drop rows with garbage (or irrelevant) data
    - drop columns that were only necessary to find garbage

- output:
    - parse version (garbage is gone)
    - date -> year
    - country -> region
    - sum and pivot on units per version
